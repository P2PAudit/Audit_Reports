## About EtherVerse Token:
The MDU token is an ERC20 token with a total supply of 1 trillion tokens. The price of each token has been hardcoded to 0.00025 Ether. Users can invest in the token using the Presale contract.

## In-Scope Contracts:
The code under review is composed of a single smart contract and interfaces written in the Solidity programming language and includes 149 nSLOC- normalized source lines of code (only source-code lines; no comments, no blank lines).

| File  | Lines  | nLines  | nSLOC  | Complex. Score  |

| contracts/MDUToken.sol  | 328 | 267  | 151  | 101  |

### Scope Details:

| Lines | 328 |
| --- | --- |
| nLines | 267 |
| nLOC | 151 |

**Complexity Score:** 101

- **Lines**: total lines of the source unit
- **nLines**: normalized lines of the source unit (e.g. normalizes functions spanning multiple lines)
- **nSLOC**: normalized source lines of code (only source-code lines; no comments, no blank lines)
- **Complexity Score**: a custom complexity score derived from code statements that are known to introduce code complexity (branches, loops, calls, external interfaces, ...)
